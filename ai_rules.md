Always fully implement code, and never create placeholders for code to be added later. Never mock-up any code or tests.

Never use comments saying "Write code here"

Never create new files. Always work with existing files.

Test steps should be checking existing implementations rather than creating it.

If test files are used, such as "filename_steps.js", those test files should always be interfacing with real logic. There should be no modeling of behaviors within the test files.
