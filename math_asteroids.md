 # Math Asteroids

A classic Asteroids-style educational game that helps students practice multiplication facts while navigating space.

## Gameplay

- Control a spaceship that rotates and moves in any direction
- Asteroids float across the screen displaying multiplication problems
- Type the answer and press spacebar to shoot
- Hit asteroids with correct answers to score points
- Game ends if your ship collides with an asteroid

## Controls

- Left/Right Arrow: Rotate ship
- Up Arrow: Thrust forward
- Number Keys: Enter answer
- Spacebar: Fire answer
- Backspace: Clear answer

## Features

### Adaptive Learning
- Tracks missed multiplication facts
- Orange asteroids indicate previously missed problems
- Double points for correctly answering missed problems
- Missed facts appear more frequently (3x exposure)

### Learning Progression
#### Problems are presented in the following order:
    x1 (identity principle)
    x2 (doubling)
    x0 
    x10
    x5
